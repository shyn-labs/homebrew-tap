  caveats <<~EOS
    Run once to install the daemon, capture agents, and menu bar app:
      shyn setup

    The honest fine print:
    - Integrity comes from this cask's sha256 (verified by Homebrew), not
      from the code signature. `shyn setup` mints a signing identity ON
      YOUR MACHINE purely so macOS permission grants survive upgrades.
    - setup clears the download quarantine (bypasses Gatekeeper's
      notarization check) with your consent — this is an unsigned
      pre-alpha dev build.
    - macOS lists the daemon's background item as "Node.js Foundation" —
        that is shyn's bundled Node runtime (official nodejs.org build,
        sha-verified), not third-party software.
      - Corporate EDR (e.g. SentinelOne) may quarantine fresh binaries; an
      exclusion for ~/Library/Application Support/shyn may be needed.
    - Everything shyn captures stays on your Mac. Nothing phones home.

    After upgrades, re-run: shyn setup   (grants persist)
    Uninstall: shyn uninstall [--purge], then brew uninstall shyn
